# Installation Instructions
Note: This only works on Windows XP and above.

Simply make a new folder RemoteExecution under %USERPROFILE%\Dropbox, and copy and paste all files in this repository into that folder. (<drive that Dropbox is installed in>\Users\<logged in user>\Dropbox\RemoteExecution\)
Then, launch watchdog.bat. If a command prompt window pops up saying "RemoteExecution successfully started", it is now working!
You may check .\Logs\output.txt for a log of startup/restarting of the application.
It is recommended to add a *link* to watchdog.bat in the Startup Folder (%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\) so it executes upon startup.

More information is available under .\Readme.md.
